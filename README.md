# Module 2 Challenge - Marnie Brannon
---------------------------------------------------------------
This is an exercise assigned to the class to demonstrate our understanding of the concepts covered in Modules 1 and 2 of AI Bootcamp.

## Motivation:
My motivation in this working on this challenge is to practice and solidify several coding concepts and Python commands, syntax, usage and best practices. I workedon this with other students in the class to help all of us share our questions, observations and ideas with one another as we learn collaboratively. - "You find yourself with someone else."
## The focus of this exercise:
This project provides an interactive food truck menu.
The following are some of the potential problems it solves:

    ‚Ä¢	reducing the amount of employee time taking orders
    
    ‚Ä¢	allowing customers to see the menu op close as well as from off site
    
    ‚Ä¢	streamlining of the order process
    
    ‚Ä¢	allows many orders to be placed simultaneuosly
    
    ‚Ä¢	What did you learn?

## Installation
Installation instructions to be added.

## Usage
 This is to be used as the customizable module which is the bulk of a larger app which will be downloaded to user's smart phones via QR code.  This code can be displayed by the food truck on their signage, ads and webpage to enable customers to view their manu and order autonomously.

________________________________________
üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
Badges
 
Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by shields.io. You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The Contributor Covenant is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
