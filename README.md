Module 2 Challenge - Marnie Brannon

This is an exercise assigned to the class to demonstrate our understanding of the concepts covered in Modules 1 and 2 of AI Bootcamp.

The focus of this exercise:
My motivation in this working on this challenge is to practice and solidify several coding concepts and Python commands, syntax, usage and best practices. I workedon this with other students in the class to help all of us share our questions, observations and ideas with one another as we learn collaboratively. - "You find yourself with someone else."

This project provides an interactive food truck menu.

Thefollowing are some of the potential problems it solves:

reducing the amount of employee time taking orders
allowing customers to see the menu op close as well as from off site
streamlining of the order process
allows many orders to be placed simultaneuosly

During the completion of this assignment, my colaborators and I used the following websites for reminders of the syntax and structure of certain commands and clarificatrion regarding the specifics of their use:
Chat GPT

I also referred to the following books for reminders, symtax rules and guidence regarding Python commands:

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to https://choosealicense.com/.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

Badges
badmath

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by shields.io. You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The Contributor Covenant is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
